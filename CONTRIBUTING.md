- Just do not use harsh language while doing any type of requests.

## :repeat: Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests whole heartedly welcomed. But keep these in mind while doing a pull request - 

- Make a issue before making the pull request
- Mention the particular issue in your pull request
- Make small changes in the pull request. Do not make big changes...
- If you are consistent contributor we will most probably invite you to the team.
