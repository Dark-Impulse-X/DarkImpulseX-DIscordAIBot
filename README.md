## Documentation
The discord bot is written in python. We have used AI, ML, NLP and LLM. Initially we are using OpenAI for first intialisation of our discord bot.
### Libraries Used 
- openai
- discord.py

### Code Explanation
**Prompt Engineering** is very essential part to make a good AI chat application

While using the OpenAI API, we have used a very cool prompt so to give our bot a particular behaviour. See the code example below where we have told hpw the bot would behave and how it should give answers-

We have developed our bot such that it takes into consideration those chats which **mentions** the bot while chatting.
