### Libraries Used 
- openai
- discord.py
- discord.py[voice] *pip install discord.py[voice]*
- requests

### Code Explanation
- **Prompt Engineering**
**Prompt Engineering** is very essential part to make a good AI chat application

While using the OpenAI API, we have used a very cool prompt so to give our bot a particular behaviour. See the code example below where we have told hpw the bot would behave and how it should give answers- 

![Snippet](https://github.com/Dark-Impulse-X/DarkImpulseX-DIscordAIBot/assets/133076612/0cd59bc0-a886-4f01-a7de-7d61fc6e824e)


- **Greeting User**
The bot checks the default text channel using the below code
```
guild.text_channels[0]
```
*a "member" represents a user within the context of a specific server (guild)*
*A "guild" is Discord's term for a server. It represents a collection of channels, roles, and members on Discord.*

The bot greets the user by making requests to [jokeapi](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) - we appreciate it a lot.

- **Joins and leaves voice channel** 
*uses python discord.py[voice]*
  - command to join - *join*
  We get the voice channel that user has joined with this code :- 
  ```
  channel = message.author.voice.channel
  ```
  and stores the channel in `self.voiceChannel`.

  - command to leave - *leave*
  Leaves the channel on user command by using the same code above to get the channel

  - leaves automatically
  checks the number of users using the code
  ```
  len(self.voiceChannel.channel.members) == 1
  ```
  then, disconnects after waiting for *1 minute*



We have developed our bot such that it takes into consideration those chats which **mentions** the bot while chatting.
